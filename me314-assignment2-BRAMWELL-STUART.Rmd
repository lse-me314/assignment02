# What is tidy data?

- Every variable has a column.
- Every observation has a row.
- Every value has a cell.

# Which rules are violated?

## 1st example

```{r}

table3 

```

`rate` has two values in each cell. It should therefore be broken up into two columns.

```{r}

table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c('cases', 'population'), sep = '/', convert = TRUE)

```

## 2nd example

```{r}

table4a 

```

`year` is a variable that is split over two columns. Year therefore needs its own column, and the values need to be shifted into a separate column.

```{r}

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'cases')

```

## 3rd example

```{r}

table2 

```

`type` contains two variables, namely cases and population. As a result, each country-year observation has two separate values. We need to pivot the data to where cases and population have their own columns.

```{r}

table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = country:year,
              names_from = type,
              values_from = count)

```

# Reshaping data in R

In this assignment, we will be working with the **tidyr** package to reshape ("pivot") the dataset [rhpi.csv](rhpi.csv) and [rpdi.csv](rpdi.csv).

These follow the examples from Chapter 12, "[Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)", from Wickham and Grolemund, [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).

You may find it useful to learn more how to use dataframes in R, read the [how-to-manipulate-dataframe.ipynb](how-to-manipulate-dataframe.ipynb).

## 1.  **Reshaping a simple example.**

a.  From the `cmpdata` object, replicate the reshaped object `cmpdataLong` from the lecture notes, using the **tidyr** package, using `pivot_longer()`.

```{r}
load("cmpdata.Rdata")

cmpdata.subset <- 
  select(cmpdata, countryname, date, partyname, 
         starts_with('per'), -pervote, -peruncod)

cmpdataLong <-
  pivot_longer(cmpdata.subset,
               cols = starts_with('per'),
               names_to = 'issue',
               values_to = 'mentions')

cmpdataLong

```

b.  Try using **tidyr** on `cmpdataLong` to "spread" this back into the wide format, but using `pivot_wider()`.

```{r}

pivot_wider(cmpdataLong,
            id_cols = c(countryname:partyname),
            names_from = issue,
            values_from = mentions)

```

## 2. Load the HPI data

a. click into the [rhpi.csv](rhpi.csv) and have a look of the data. Does it have any header? How is each entry of the data separated? by space or comma?

b. take a look of the [```read.csv```](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/read.table.html) function and read the csv data to r.

```{r}

hpi <- read.csv('rhpi.csv')

```

c. after the data is loaded into r, you can use [```head```](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/head.html) function to take a look of the first few rows of data. Is it in long or wide format?

```{r}

head(hpi)

```


d. you may find out that the first column name is empty. You may update the first column name to "country" by using [```colnames```](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/colnames.html) function. And remember R starts counting from 1!

```{r}
## your code (filled in for you already)

rhpi_wide <- read.csv("rhpi.csv") #if this line does not work, check where you are by getwd()
head(rhpi_wide)
colnames(rhpi_wide)[1] <- "country"
head(rhpi_wide)

```

## 3. Convert the HPI data from wide to long

The original HPI data is in wide format. Each row represents a country and each column represents a quarter. This means that each row has the HPI values of **one** country and **different** quarters.

Here we would like to change it to long format so that each row has the a HPI value of **one** country and **one** quarter:

a. take a look of the [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html) function and convert the the HPI data into long format.

b. use [`head()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/head.html) to take a look of the data

c. you will notice that the quarter value somehow has the X at the beginning (e.g. X1970.Q3 instead of 1970.Q3). If you want to remove the X from the quarter value, take a look of the [`substring()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/substr.html) function.

```{r}

rhpi.long <- pivot_longer(rhpi_wide, 
                          cols = -country, 
                          names_to = 'quarter',
                          values_to = 'hpi')

rhpi.long <- mutate(rhpi.long, quarter = substring(quarter, 2, 8))

head(rhpi.long)

```

## 4. Load the PDI data and convert the PDI data from wide to long

```{r}
## your code (filled in for you already)

rpdi_wide <- read.csv("rpdi.csv") #if this line does not work, check where you are by getwd()
head(rpdi_wide)
colnames(rpdi_wide)[1] <- "country"
head(rpdi_wide)
```

```{r}

rpdi.long <- pivot_longer(rpdi_wide, 
                          cols = -country, 
                          names_to = 'quarter',
                          values_to = 'pdi')

rpdi.long <- mutate(rpdi.long, quarter = substring(quarter, 2, 8))

head(rpdi.long)

```

## 5. Merge the long format HPI and PDI data

a. take a look of the [`merge())`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/merge.html) function and merge the two dataframes together.  You should provide the "```by```" argument. What should be the unique identifier? Country? Quarter? Or both?

```{r}

merged.data <- merge(rhpi.long,
                     rpdi.long,
                     by = c('country', 'quarter'))

```


b. take a look of the merged data using [`head())`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/head.html) to make sure the data are merged properly.

```{r}

head(merged.data)

```

## 6. Filter the data

a. take a look of the [`which())`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/which.html) function. This function will return you the indices that a given condition is fulfilled.

b. filter the data so that only Australia data is shown.

```{r}

filtered.data <- merged.data[which(merged.data$country == 'Australia'),]

# Or tidyverse equivalent

filtered.data <- filter(merged.data, country == 'Australia')

```

c. use [`head())`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/head.html) and [`tail()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/head.html) functions to take a look of the data to make sure you filtered the data correctly.

```{r}

head(filtered.data)

```


## 7. Make the data the data

Try to use the `pivot_longer()` function again to produce a dataframe that is similar to this object:

Note: I've nearly replicated this but can't get the exact order.

```{r}

replicated.data <-
  merged.data %>% 
  select(Quarter = quarter, Country = country, RHPI = hpi, RPDI = pdi) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(RHPI, RPDI),
               names_to = 'Index Type',
               values_to = 'Value') %>% 
  mutate(Quarter = str_replace(Quarter, '\\.', ':')) %>% 
  arrange(Quarter, `Index Type`, Value) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

rownames(replicated.data) <- 0:7773

head(replicated.data, 10)

tail(replicated.data, 10)

```
